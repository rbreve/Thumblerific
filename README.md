#Thumblerific#

Thumblerific lets you make thumbnails from image urls.
It runs on Google App Engine.

It works like this

Say you find a hosted image 

http://somesite.com/image.jpg

with thumblerific you could make thumbnails for that image like this

http://thumblerific.appsppot.com/t?image_url=http://somesite.com/image.jpg&width=90

This will return a 90px thumbnail. This will allow you to make thumbnails on the fly from your html, calling the <img> tag.

Its that easy and simple.
