#Thumblerific#

Thumblerific lets you make thumbnails from image urls.
It runs on Google App Engine.

It works like this

Say you find a hosted image 

    http://somesite.com/image.jpg

with thumblerific you could make a 90px thumbnail for that image like this

    http://thumblerific.appsppot.com/t?image_url=http://somesite.com/image.jpg&width=90
    
This also allows you to make thumbnails on the fly from your html, calling the &lt;img&gt; tag.

Its that easy and simple.
